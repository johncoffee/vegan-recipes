# Units used in these recipes

The amounts given in the recipes are unit-less but relative. You'll have an easy time scaling the portion to more people :\)

We can not be bothered using either weight, volumetric units, or grandmas "3 table spoons of.." \(sorry grandma\). As master chefs we'll always taste our food as we cook and add a little here and there anyways, therefore specifying amounts precisely is irelevant.

#### Example:

**ingredients**  
3 carrots  
2 flour  
1 honey  
0,1 almonds \(chopped\)

...Would mean 3x as many carrots as honey.  
eg 300 gm carrots to 100 gm honey  
_**or**_   
2 dl carrots to 0,66 dl honey
