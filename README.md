# Vegan recipes

Backstory: When i was little, i loved eating food. Now as an adult, I've dedicated my life to eating food at least 3 times a day.   
  
I will share some recipes with the world, although I've mostly freestyled until now, theres a good handful of recipes i've come around to make again. Starting to write this book i decided it was time to specify, standardise and write down the most successful experiments....

**Whenever you randomly cook a nice novel dish, why not write it down for others?**

This is a collaborative book! Please add recipes if you feel like it :\) \(ask me for help with gitbook/github if you need it\).
